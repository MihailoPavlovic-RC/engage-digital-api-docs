Welcome RingCentral Developer! Here you have access to all the resources necessary to build an app successfully on the RingCentral RingCX Platform. Here are some specific resources and guides to help you get started.

## Interactions

On RingCX Platform, interactions refer to the conversations agents have with customers throughout their greater social media and customer engagement ecosystem. The Interaction API is what developers can use for managing and automating incoming customer engagements. 

### Build a Chat Bot

One of the most popular ways of extending the RingCentral RingCX's functionality is with apps to automate customer interactions, also known as chat bots. Chat bots provide a natural and conversational way to interface with third-party systems, as well as to assist in workflow automation.
